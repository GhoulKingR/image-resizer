A CLI for resizing your images

positional arguments:
  image                 A path to the image you want to resize

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        If you want to specify the output file. The output file is output.jpg by default.
  --width WIDTH         The new width you want to resize the image to.
  --height HEIGHT       The new height you want to resize the image to.
```
## Resizing an image
The following is the format for resizing an image with `image-resizer`:
```bash
image-resizer [--width <px> | --height <px>] </path/to/image/file>
```
> The `--width` and `--height` arguments are for specifying the width and height that you want to resize the image to. To avoid stretching the image, the image's aspect ratio is maintained. And you're not allowed to change both the width and height parameters at the same time.
Take a look at these examples:
```bash
image-resizer --width 500 image.jpg    # resize the image to a width of 500px
image-resizer --height 500 image.jpg   # resize the image to a height of 500px
```
By default, `image-resizer` saves the output of the image to an `output.jpg` file in the current working directory. If you want to save your resized image to a different file, `image-resizer` allows you to do so with an `--output` (`-o` for short) option that you can set. For example:
```bash
image-resizer --width 500 -o my-file.png image.jpg
```
